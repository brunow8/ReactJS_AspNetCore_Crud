To run the backend part of this application you need to have Visual Studio 2019+ or some other IDE installed on your device. 
In the case of Visua Studio you need to do the following steps to make the connection to the database:

#### Package Manager Console
- add-migration "The name you want to give your first migration"
- Update-Database

And with these command lines done, you can then access Swagger where you can do all kinds of actions to add, edit, and delete 
people with the database connection already done.
